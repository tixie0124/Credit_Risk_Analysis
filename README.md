# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the precision, sensitivity and other matrix of the machine learning models, which implements various data sampling techniques in predicting credit risk for LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending company. The performance of the models are analyzed and a recommendation of the most applicable model is made. The techniques were used in the model include: oversampling, undersampling, a combination of both, and the SMOTEENN algorithm.

## Results
**Naive Oversampling**<br />
